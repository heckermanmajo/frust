Frust Build 0.0
---------
- not too big maps (32*32 tiles) * 3 * 3
- no advanced pathfinding (only astar)
- we can only do 3 path-findings per frame
- but chunking (needed for efficient collision)
- map movement -> move the map with middle mouse
- Camera
- draw and collision protocol
- do random path-findings
- do random obstacles
- scroll in/out
- debug info
- simple map loading -> use to non-recursive repr functions
- place obstacles (user controller) (water/stone) - load and save

TODOS
------
- import camera and view map
- start: Load and save map with tests
